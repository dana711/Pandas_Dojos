# Visualization_Dojo

This repo has python code that shows how to read in the IMDB dataset and create plots to visualize the data.



IMDBChart_bar.py:

This python code reads in the IMDB Dataset and does the following:
- Standardize the content_ratings column
- Set the title, xlabel, ylabel
- Create a bar graph to display the movie content raiting
- Save the plot as a png file

You can change the column name to plot different fields of data in the dataset.
